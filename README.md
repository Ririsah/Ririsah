<h1>Hi! 👋👋👋</h1>

   I'm Clara, 26 years old, and a Front-end developer! (cat lover btw 🐈)

   Back in 2023, I started learning Front-end and immediately fell in love with it. 
I've always been passionate about art and design. I'm an artist, so I draw my own characters, 
create my own designs, and even make my own clothes from time to time!
   Meanwhile, I'm a nerd too. ☝️🤓 Love playing all night with friends, watch some anime, 
and dive into RPGs. Last but not least: huge Pokémon fan. HUGE! 😤 (Garchomp supremacy 💪). 

   In short, I'm obsessed with art and technology! 🧡💛💚💙💜
   
   Well, you might be thinking: 'Why is this girl telling me all this random stuff?' 🙉 
I know it sounds super random — even to me, to be honest — but someday in my adult life, 
when I was feeling really sad and stressed about my career and future, I realized that 
I’m probably never going to find a perfect job that I love completely, couse there’s no such 
thing as a perfect job. And that’s totally normal!

  I started searching for something related to the things I love to do, and during my loooong journey, 
I bumped into Front-end. It was love at first sight! 😔💗 Ever since then, I’ve been studying every
single day, because I need to, and because I love it! Watching my projects improve and seeing everything
I’ve learned so far keeps the fire in me to grow more and more. Seriously, best feeling ever!
Of course, I struggle sometimes — but that’s part of the process. And being able to solve a problem 
you’ve been stuck on? So satisfying! 🤠

  That was a quick summary of my experience so far. I love art, technology, my cat, and now, Front-end. 🤞
  (I'm not confident in my English, so sorry if something sounds a bit off! 🥴)
